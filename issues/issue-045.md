For [IP](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~adiftene/Scoala/2017/IP/index.htm) we have used [appear.in](http://appear.in) and it seems it worked pretty well for the team. We can use it for our project too.

[Link](https://appear.in/condr) for our room.

Main points are:
- works cross platform pretty well
- it works out of the box, for the screensharing to work you need an easily instalable browser extension
- supports group screensharing
- audio and video communication for team communication
- can be used for pair programming, we can work collaboratively on the same piece of code
- overall a pretty good tool

We used this lately, worked pretty well as a pair programming tool, the issue can be closed.
