Ca să scriem cod frumos, putem urmări recomandări legate de scrierea codului PHP

This section of the standard comprises what should be considered the standard coding elements that are required to ensure a high level of technical interoperability between shared PHP code.

Overview

- Files MUST use only &lt;?php and &lt;?&#x3D; tags.
- Files MUST use only UTF-8 without BOM for PHP code.
- Files SHOULD either declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.) or cause side-effects (e.g. generate output, change .ini settings, etc.) but SHOULD NOT do both.
- Namespaces and classes MUST follow an “autoloading” PSR: [PSR-0, PSR-4].
- Class names MUST be declared in StudlyCaps.
- Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.
- Method names MUST be declared in camelCase.
