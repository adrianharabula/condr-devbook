### More examples

This will get us all characteristics for a product
```bash
>>> $p = \App\Product::find(1)
>>> $p->characteristics
=> Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection {#775
     all: [
       App\Characteristic {#781
         id: "1",
         name: "color",
         created_at: "2017-06-03 14:55:39",
         updated_at: "2017-06-03 14:55:39",
         pivot: Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphPivot {#776
           characterizable_id: "1",
           characteristic_id: "1",
           cvalue: "Peanut Butter",
           cvotes: "3",
         },
       },
       App\Characteristic {#785
         id: "2",
         name: "size",
         created_at: "2017-06-03 14:55:39",
         updated_at: "2017-06-03 14:55:39",
         pivot: Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphPivot {#782
           characterizable_id: "1",
           characteristic_id: "2",
           cvalue: "16-oz box",
           cvotes: "7",
         },
       },
       App\Characteristic {#786
         id: "3",
         name: "dimension",
         created_at: "2017-06-03 14:55:39",
         updated_at: "2017-06-03 14:55:39",
         pivot: Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphPivot {#774
           characterizable_id: "1",
           characteristic_id: "3",
           cvalue: "2 X 6.5 X 9 inches",
           cvotes: "0",
         },
       },
       App\Characteristic {#787
         id: "4",
         name: "weight",
         created_at: "2017-06-03 14:55:39",
         updated_at: "2017-06-03 14:55:39",
         pivot: Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphPivot {#777
           characterizable_id: "1",
           characteristic_id: "4",
           cvalue: "1 Pounds",
           cvotes: "4",
         },
       },
     ],
   }
```

To get just one

```bash
>>> $p->characteristics[0]
=> App\Characteristic {#781
     id: "1",
     name: "color",
     created_at: "2017-06-03 14:55:39",
     updated_at: "2017-06-03 14:55:39",
     pivot: Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphPivot {#776
       characterizable_id: "1",
       characteristic_id: "1",
       cvalue: "Peanut Butter",
       cvotes: "3",
     },
   }
```

To get characteristic name, value and votes

```bash
>>> 'Characteristic `' . $p->characteristics[0]->name . '` with value `' . $p->characteristics[0]->pivot->cvalue . '` has ' . $p->characteristics[0]->pivot->cvotes . ' votes.'
=> "Characteristic `color` with value `Peanut Butter` has 3 votes."

```

To attach a characteristic to a entity

```bash
>>> $u = \App\User::find(1)
=> App\User {#770
     id: "1",
     name: "Adrian HarabulÄƒ",
     email: "adrian.harabula@gmail.com",
     created_at: null,
     updated_at: null,
   }
>>> $p=\App\Product::find(1);

>>> $u->characteristics()->attach($p->characteristics[0], ['cvalue' => 'red'])
=> null
>>> $u->characteristics
=> Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection {#764
     all: [

           characterizable_id: "1",
           characteristic_id: "1",
           cvalue: "red",
