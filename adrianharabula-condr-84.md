We&#x27;ve got [these](https://github.com/adrianharabula/condr/tree/dd9bd093983f4465338372bb60e1b3018807bd4b/Dockerfiles/oracledb/sqlscripts) scripts working on first time initialization.

What we need to do is to find a way to make migration run automatically on first run. Not important, but it would be nice to find a way.

That would automate just everything!!!!

Avem install instructions aici https://github.com/adrianharabula/condr/wiki/Install-instructions. Nu cred că voi mai continua cu automatizarea pentru că nu îi mai văd rostul. Dacă va fi cazul voi redeschide issueul.
